# VUKA Backend

## Overview

Vuka is a platform designed to help high-school graduates in Kenya turn educational social-media engagement into structured career and skills development. VUKA combines personalized onboarding, educational content discovery, AI-generated assessments, progress tracking, career opportunities, and graduate verification into a single backend platform.

This repository contains the **VUKA backend API**, built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLAlchemy**. It handles authentication, onboarding, content discovery, assessments, progress tracking, and opportunity recommendations.

## Key Features

* **User management** — Registration and authentication using email and password, with stateless session management for multi-device access.
* **Content pathways** — Uses site-restricted keyword searches to discover educational content and link users to relevant learning resources on TikTok and YouTube.
* **Verified assessments** — Provides dynamic quizzes and check-ins to verify learning before awarding progress points.
* **User progress tracking** — Tracks experience points (XP), assessment performance, and consecutive-day streaks.
* **Opportunity recommendations** — Connects users with relevant scholarships, bootcamps, and other career opportunities based on their progress and interests.

## Data Model

The database design is documented in the project's **ERD documentation** in `docs/`.

At a high level, the core tables are:

| Table                        | Purpose                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `registration`               | Stores user account and authentication information.                       |
| `onboarding-assessment`      | Stores career interests, baseline skills, and preferred social platforms. |
| `content_pathway`            | Stores personalized educational content recommendations.                  |
| `verified_assessments`       | Stores assessment checkpoints, submissions, and results.                  |
| `user_progress`              | Tracks XP, progress, and daily streaks.                                   |
| `opportunity_recommendation` | Stores relevant scholarships, bootcamps, and career opportunities.        |

### Entity Relationships

* One **registration account** → one **onboarding assessment** (1:1)
* One **onboarding assessment** → many **content pathways** (1:N)
* One **registration account** → many **verified assessments** (1:N)
* One **content pathway** → many **verified assessments** (1:N)
* One **registration account** → many **user progress** records (1:N)
* One **registration account** → many **opportunity recommendations** (1:N)
